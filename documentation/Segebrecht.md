# Segebrecht
## Description
In 1986, the German literary scholar Wulf Segebrecht published the first edition of *Was sollen Germanisten lesen? Ein Vorschlag* (*What Should German Philologists Read? A Suggestion*), which has since appeared in a third edition (2006). In this well-known work, Segebrecht lists more than 700 works of German literature — from the Middle Ages to the present — that, in his view, German philologists should or could read. According to him, the list includes many works “of central literary-historical significance and high aesthetic ambition” (Segebrecht 2006: 9).

## Data Collection
We manually copied the entries from Segebrecht’s *Was sollen Germanisten lesen?*. When Segebrecht refers to anthologies, he often explicitly names some of the authors featured in them. We have not included these individual author mentions and list only the anthologies themselves along with their respective editors. Likewise, we have excluded the references to non-German authors from world literature that appear in a fictional “protest note” (pp. 30–31) in which the authors demand to be included as well.
