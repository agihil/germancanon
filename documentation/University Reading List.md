# University Reading Lists
## Description
A university reading list is a compilation of literary works assembled by German studies departments or individual instructors. The aim is to have students read these texts over the course of their academic training. These lists serve as didactic tools, providing orientation in literary history. The present analysis is based on 42 reading lists from German studies departments in German-speaking countries: Germany (34), Austria (5), Switzerland (2), and Luxembourg (1). At the time of data collection (2021 to 2023), the reading lists were publicly accessible online. According to information provided either on the lists themselves or on the associated websites, the lists were created between 2003/04 and 2023; however, the year of origin could be determined for only 17 of the lists.

The file "bdsl.csv" contains the following columns:
<ul>
<li>GND: GND identifier for the respective author.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

## Data Collection
The titles and authors listed on the reading lists were manually entered into a table. The following guidelines were observed during data entry:
<ul>
<li>Not all titles appearing on a given reading list were included. The following categories were not recorded consistently: literature published before 1600, non-German-language literature, and works from the field of literary studies (e.g., literary histories, encyclopedias, etc.).</li>
<li>Anthologies were marked with a ‘$’ at the beginning of the entry. Editors are listed in the author column and marked with '(Hg.)'.</li>
<li>The spelling of authors’ names and titles was adopted directly from the reading lists. In cases of inconsistent spelling across a list, the version used in the first entry was retained.</li>
<li>The year indicated is generally the year of publication or, in the case of plays, the year of the premiere. In some cases, the year of composition was entered for plays instead.</li>
<li>There are instances in which only the author’s name and a literary genre are listed (e.g., Karoline von Günderrode: Lyrik). In such cases, the genre is recorded as the title, and the year is typically the average of the author’s birth and death years.</li>
<li>Some of the reading lists offer students a choice of titles either at specific points or as a guiding principle for the entire list. For example, students may be asked to select between two Brecht works, choose 5 out of 20 listed novels, or read 50 of the 100 titles provided. This optionality is reflected in the data. For each title, the probability that a student will have read the text if they follow the reading list’s guidelines is indicated (e.g., 0.5, 0.25, 0.5). When interpreting the data, it should be taken into account that such choices can only be represented when an exact number is specified. Although some reading lists indicate that students are not required to read all texts, they do not quantify this. This cannot be reflected in the data.</li>
<li>If both a general work and a specific title from that work are given, both are recorded separately. For example: “Heine: Reisebilder (at least: Harzreise).” A value of 1 is recorded for both "Reisebilder" and "Harzreise".</li>
</ul>
