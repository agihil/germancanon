# Kanon-Spiel
## Description
The ‘Canon Game’ (German: Kanon-Spiel) is a collective voting initiative designed to identify literary texts that “ideally everyone should have read” (“möglichst jeder gelesen haben sollte”) or “whose thorough knowledge is considered indispensable” (“deren gute Kenntnis Sie für unabdingbar halten”). The project was initiated primarily by Thomas Anz in collaboration with <i>literaturkritik.de</i>. The result is a list currently comprising 105 narrative texts and dramas, along with 54 poems. Each text is assigned a specific number of points based on the aggregated voting results.

Five voting rounds have been completed in total (1st round: February 2001; 2nd: November 2001; 3rd: 2003; 5th: 2004), although the complete results from these early rounds are no longer available. Since 2004, participation has been open to everyone online.



The file "staatsexamen.csv" contains the following columns:
<ul>
<li><i>GND:</i> GND identifier for the respective author.</li>
<li><i>author:</i> The names of the authors of the literary works; the authors’ names consist primarily of surnames only and have been adopted directly in the spelling used by Thomas Anz (2004); this does not necessarily have to match the spelling used in the GND.</li>
<li><i>title:</i> The titles of the literary works; the titles have been adopted directly in the spelling used by Thomas Anz (2004).</li>
<li><i>points:</i> As our metric, we use the aggregated point total that the works of the respective authors achieved in the 'Canon Game'.</li>
<li><i>list_type:</i> Information on whether the literary text is listed under 'Narrative Texts and Dramas' or under 'Poetry'.</li>
</ul>
