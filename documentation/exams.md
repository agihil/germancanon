# Exams
## Description
Another primary indicator of canonicity is university examinations. These assessments, whether written or oral, are typically administered by individual instructors, which makes them difficult to analyze systematically.

In some German federal states there are so-called "Staatsexamen" (state examinations). These are not university-based exams but are administered by official state examination boards. The secondary indicator consists of 531 written exam questions from state examinations, conducted in the state of Bavaria between 1989 and 1999.


The file "staatsexamen.csv" contains the following columns:
<ul>
<li>GND: GND identifier for the respective author.</li>
<li>author: The authors’ names consist primarily of surnames only and have been adopted directly in the original spelling used by Elisabeth Stuck (2004). This does not necessarily have to match the spelling used in the GND.</li>
<li>count_exams: Frequency of occurrence in exam questions.</li> 
</ul>

When using the exams data, cite the following: Stuck, Elisabeth: Kanon und Literaturstudium. Theoretische, historische und empirische Untersuchungen zum akademischen Umgang mit Lektüre-Empfehlungen. Paderborn 2004.


## Data Collection
The data were presumably collected manually by Elisabeth Stuck. We have only transferred the results into a table here. There were 399 author citations; Stuck named a total of 109 different authors, while we list 110 authors because we separated the Brothers Grimm. It should also be noted that Stuck generally lists only the authors’ surnames. Therefore, when linking to the GND, we had to interpret which author was most likely meant. In most cases the identification was straightforward. Two authors could not be clearly identified: “Bredel, B.” and “Vogt, H.”.
