# School Reading List
## Description



The file "staatsexamen.csv" contains the following columns:
<ul>
<li>GND: GND identifier for the respective author.</li>
<li>author: The authors’ names consist primarily of surnames only and have been adopted directly in the original spelling used by Elisabeth Stuck (2004). This does not necessarily have to match the spelling used in the GND.</li>
<li>count_exams: Frequency of occurrence in exam questions.</li> 
</ul>

When using the school reading list data, cite the following: Carolin Müller-Spitzer, Thomas Wortmann, Sascha Wolfer: Bildungsrelevante Lektüre war und ist vorwiegend von Männern verfasste Literatur. Eine qualitativ-quantitative Auswertung von offiziellen Lektüreempfehlungen für den gymnasialen Deutschunterricht, in: Mitteilungen des DGV 70:2, 2023, S. 198–218


## Data Collection
The data were presumably collected manually by Elisabeth Stuck. We have only transferred the results into a table here. There were 399 author citations; Stuck named a total of 109 different authors, while we list 110 authors because we separated the Brothers Grimm. It should also be noted that Stuck generally lists only the authors’ surnames. Therefore, when linking to the GND, we had to interpret which author was most likely meant. In most cases the identification was straightforward. Two authors could not be clearly identified: “Bredel, B.” and “Vogt, H.”. Stuck listed one author ("Hebel") twice.
