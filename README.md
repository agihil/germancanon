## 🚀 Quick Access

The file `canonicity_scores.xlsx` in the folder `data/` lists more than 5,000 authors of German-language literature (from roughly 1600 onward) along with their corresponding canonicity scores.

- `GND` – GND identifier of the author  
- `author` – author name according to the GND
- `canonicity_score` – Score ranging from 1 to 1000, where higher values indicate a more canonical author  
- `canonicity_rank` – Rank of the author, where lower numbers correspond to higher canonical status

*Example*: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (`GND: 118540238`) has a canonicity score of 1000 and holds rank 1, making him the most canonical author of newer German-language literature.
